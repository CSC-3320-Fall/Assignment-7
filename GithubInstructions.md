# Github Instructions
- Just like the last assigment, crease a folder with your CampusID as the name.
- Edit only that folder. If I mad spelling errors anywhere in the document feel free to correct them. 
- Use the Issues feature to ask questions or help.
- All questions asked this way will be public.
