couldn't get it to push without erasing so i just wanted to share my thoughts on how i attempted #2. 


#include<stdio.h>

/*this program is supposed to take in the text.two.encrypted
 *file and with the function find the period
 *it should do so by enciphering the first letter of the file
 *and then continuing until so, and then the sequence is repeated
 *with that key. assuming the key length then average out the incidence
 *of coincidence to see the highest which will be the location
 */

int main() {

        int d = 0;
        FILE *p;
        int num = 0;
        int ic = 0;
        int den = 0;
        int alpha[26] = {0};

        p = fopen("/home/local/GSUAD/rwh/assignment7/text.two.encrypt", "r");
        
         while (d = fgetc(p) != EOF)             //run till end
        {
                if (d  >= 'a' && d <= 'z')      //if current is between a and z
                {
                        alpha[d-'a'] +=1;    //get next alpha char
                }
        d++;
        }

        //figuring out incidence of coincidence
        for (int i=0; i< 26; i++)
        {
                num += alpha[i] * (alpha[i] -1);
        }
        den = d * (d - 1);
        ic = num/den;

/*it should then compare to see which incidence of coincidence is highest
 * to then be able to print the period. */

        fclose(p);
        return 0;
}
